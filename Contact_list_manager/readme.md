In this project, the goal was to make a programm that can keep track of a contact list. This programm should have different options like "add", "remove", "list" or "save" grouped in some menu. 
The user will choose from this menu and based of his choise, the programm will operate different things. If "add" is choosed, then the user will provide some values for new contact like: first name, last name (mention that first and last name are mandatory.
"Remove" option will first get some inputs from user and will check if that contact exists in the current contact list. "list" will provide the current list of all SAVED contacts, and will print out just the fileds that are NOT EMPTY.
Last but not least, after a new contact that has been added, that contact will be saved only if "q" option from menu is choosen. Otherwhise that contact will not be saved and will not be added to the contact list.
I mention that THE USER MUST CREATE A NEW JSON FILE AND ADD IT TO THE PATH
