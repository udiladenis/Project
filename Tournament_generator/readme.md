For this project I created a program that can schedule games that teams will play in an end of year tournament. This app provides the games and teams that will play in the first round of a final tournament
The user must provide the number of teams and a name for each team. Also, the number of games and wins for each team must be specified by the user. The names of teams must allwas be at most from 2 words and at least 2 charaters. At the end, games will be printed as "HOME VS AWAY" where the "home team" will be the team with the less wins in the season and the "away team" will be the team wilargest number of wins.
